# Image segmentation using k-means algorithm
This repository contains program to perform image segmentation i.e. dividing the image into user-defined number of classes using k-means algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented from scratch without using any inbuilt cv2 function. The below image of "traffic signal" has been divided into 4 classes.  

## Instructions to run the code:  
```
python k_means.py
```
